				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Removing Kentucky: I rated this design decision a -1. I removed Kentucky from this bar graph as it was an outlier. I am plotting the percentage change of abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020 in Southern states. I was able to see a trend that Southern states had a mostly negative percentage change with a few outliers. Yet, Kentucky was a stark outlier with a 100% percent change from 2017 to 2020. Because this would completely take away from my argument, I decided to delete the Kentucky percentage from my graph so that my point could be more persuasive as it would show that abortion clinics were becoming less accessible in Southern states over time with only some slight outliers. It worked well as the percent changes were all generally low, but if someone was looking for Kentucky, they would see that it was removed from the visual. This might in a way take from the visualization's credibility. I considered skewing the percentages so that the gaps would be larger near the bottom and grow closer as we reached higher percentages, but I realized that it would be very easy to catch that change. Since there was only one state that ruined my visualization, it seemed the only logical thing to do was to remove it.
                </li>
				<li>Adding an annotation: I rated this decision a 1. I provided a small annotation explaining why North Carolina and Texas had an increase in abortion clinics rather than the other Southern states. I felt this to be a rather earnest design choice as it gives an honest explanation as to why there are two data points that directly contradict my claim. However, it does expect that readers are familiar that Democrats tend to be more pro-choice. This annotation states that those states have higher Democrat percentages compared to Republic percentages and cite two reliable sources. This makes my visualization persuasive as it explains right away the only part of the visualization that someone could attempt to counter the claim with. I think the credibility of the researchers also helps in making the visualization persuasive as it does not seem that I am just trying to cover up the graph's flaws. I considered omitting Florida and North Carolina just as I did with Kentucky, however those seemed as states that would be noticed if missing. I also had the political context of knowing that there are many cities in these states with a generally liberal population. 
                </li>
				<li>Modifying Percent cut-offs: I rated this decision a -0.5. The decision to have the maximum percentage on the axes be very close to the largest possible percentage on both sides of the axis seemed a bit deceptive. In doing this, it made it seem that the negative change in abortion clinics were much more drastic than they genuinely were. This design choice makes the visualization more persuasive, as readers will simply see a large amount of bars that get very close to the edge of the graph. This leads them to subconsciously think that this is a great change even though they can still see the percent it was changed. I considered not modifying these percent bounds to be more earnest. However, I figured that it was no longer an issue of being deceptive or not because it seemed more clean to have data fill a chart rather than there being so much empty space.</li>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Keeping All states: I rated this design decision a 1. The decision to include all states in the visualization was a tough decision to make. I really wanted to delete a state that has ridiculously low abortion clinics. It did not help prove my point at all. However, I figured I had to keep it in because it was not that dramatic of a difference. I felt that showing more states would make the visualization more full which people typically associate with credibility. Though it did hurt the overall more persuasiveness of the visualization, I do think that credibility is a sneakily important aspect to a graph. If you are trying to represent raw data, it is hard to believe what you are conveying if the data is accurate.</li>
				<li>Not showing northern states also observed increases: I rated this design decision a -0.5.   The decision to not show northern states was made in order to hide the fact that all states had this increase. It was not something speicfic to Southern states who saw an influx of population due to the housing crisis. Numbers simply raised for population reasons, not because it became more accesible. This was persuasive as ths graph does not mention anywhere the overall change in population, so it simply makes it just seem like an unexpected increase. </li>
				<li>Adjusting chart area to make change looked large: I rated this decision to be a -1. It seemed like a bit of a cheap move. However, it did make the graph seem more persuasive pehaps even in an obvious way. By making the area look larger, it seemed like an actually statistically significant increase. However, anyone who views the visualization for quite sometime would probably be able to see through it. I was considering not making this choice as it seemed maybe too obvious, but I felt the graph without it barely supported the point.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>[This was by far the most difficult assignment in the class for me. It seemed quite difficult to me to make visualizations prove a point that the raw data simply did not agree with. I found myself constantly recreating visualizations as all of my efforts to be deceptive were quite obvious. It also added quite some time to my visualization creation process as I was now wondering how important it was to not compromise the data. The full focus of a graph should simply be a visual aide. It was quite surprising to me how easy it was to lie through numbers. Coming from a primarily STEM background, I always found a sense of safety in numbers. They were simply strings of data that always had a right answer. When researching deceptive visualizations, I was shocked at how easily researchers were able to twist and turn numbers to suit their fancy. This assignment showed me how anything is possible if there is the want to, and to spend an extra minute checking out visualizations to make sure I am not being lied to.
		I now define 'ethical analysis and visualization' much differently. Before creating these visualizations, I assumed ethics were implied in visualizations. I had doubts that graphs could be despective when they were supposed to just represent raw data. I now recognize that ethical analysis and visualization is a conscientious decision made by the creator. They must make sure their data is reliable and their graph unbiased. There can not be a bound drawn to distinguish 'acceptable' persuasive choices vs 'misleading' choices because every visualization is unique. Applying logarithmic actions to percentages might be useful in some visualization whereas in others it could completely skew the reader's interpretations. All in all, I completely understand that it is helpful to have visualizations to support the ideas of the writer. Yet, one must create visualizations knowing that it is readers who trust the author's credibility to not deceive.
