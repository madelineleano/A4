				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Removing Kentucky: I rated this design decision a -1. I removed Kentucky from this bar graph as it was an outlier. I am plotting the percentage change of abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020 in Southern states. I was able to see a trend that Southern states had a mostly negative percentage change with a few outliers. Yet, Kentucky was a stark outlier with a 100% percent change from 2017 to 2020. Because this would completely take away from my argument, I decided to delete the Kentucky percentage from my graph so that my point could be more persuasive as it would show that abortion clinics were becoming less accessible in Southern states over time with only some slight outliers. It worked well as the percent changes were all generally low, but if someone was looking for Kentucky, they would see that it was removed from the visual. This might in a way take from the visualization's credibility. I considered skewing the percentages so that the gaps would be larger near the bottom and grow closer as we reached higher percentages, but I realized that it would be very easy to catch that change. Since there was only one state that ruined my visualization, it seemed the only logical thing to do was to remove it.
                </li>
				<li>Adding an annotation: I rated this decision a 1. I provided a small annotation explaining why North Carolina and Texas had an increase in abortion clinics rather than the other Southern states. I felt this to be a rather earnest design choice as it gives an honest explanation as to why there are two data points that directly contradict my claim. However, it does expect that readers are familiar that Democrats tend to be more pro-choice. This annotation states that those states have higher Democrat percentages compared to Republic percentages and cite two reliable sources. This makes my visualization persuasive as it explains right away the only part of the visualization that someone could attempt to counter the claim with. I think the credibility of the researchers also helps in making the visualization persuasive as it does not seem that I am just trying to cover up the graph's flaws. I considered omitting Florida and North Carolina just as I did with Kentucky, however those seemed as states that would be noticed if missing. I also had the political context of knowing that there are many cities in these states with a generally liberal population. 
                </li>
				<li>Modifying Percent cut-offs: I rated this decision a -0.5. The decision to have the maximum percentage on the axes be very close to the largest possible percentage on both sides of the axis seemed a bit deceptive. In doing this, it made it seem that the negative change in abortion clinics were much more drastic than they genuinely were. This design choice makes the visualization more persuasive, as readers will simply see a large amount of bars that get very close to the edge of the graph. This leads them to subconsciously think that this is a great change even though they can still see the percent it was changed. I considered not modifying these percent bounds to be more earnest. However, I figured that it was no longer an issue of being deceptive or not because it seemed more clean to have data fill a chart rather than there being so much empty space.</li>
